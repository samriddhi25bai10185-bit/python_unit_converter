# Project Statement

## 📌 Problem Statement
Users frequently need to convert between different units such as Length, Weight, Time, and Temperature for academics, engineering tasks, daily usage, and calculations.  
Manually remembering formulas or searching online every time is inconvenient and error-prone.  

There is a need for a **simple, fast, offline, and modular Python-based Smart Unit Converter** that performs these conversions accurately using a clean and menu-driven interface.


## 🎯 Scope of the Project
The scope of this project includes:
- Developing a modular Python program that performs conversions for **Length, Weight, Time, and Temperature**.
- Implementing a user-friendly **command-line interface (CLI)**.
- Structuring the code using separate function modules.
- Ensuring accurate mathematical conversion formulas.
- Designing the system so that more units or categories can be added easily.

This project does **NOT** include:
- GUI applications (Tkinter, web apps)  
- Data persistence or history storage  
- Online API-based unit conversions  
- Complex scientific or financial conversions  


## 👥 Target Users
This application is intended for:
- Students performing academic calculations or lab work  
- Teachers and educational institutions  
- Programmers needing a quick offline conversion tool  
- Professionals in science and engineering  
- Anyone who needs quick and reliable unit conversions
